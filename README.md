# TSPTFBS-2.0
TSPTFBS 2.0 is a webserver based on deep learning models for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction. It can be used to mine the potential core motifs within a given sequence by the trained 389 TFBS prediction models of three species (Zea mays, Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa) and the interpretability algorithm Deeplift. TSPTFBS 2.0 is freely accessible for all users. 
## Python programs for predicting TFBS and performing DeepLIFT and TF-MoDISco.
## Dependencies
The program requires:
  * python==3.7.13
  * tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0 (for model training)
  * tensorfow==1.14.0 (for DeepLIFT, TF-MoDISco and model predicting)
  * deeplift
  * modisco
  * keras==2.3.1.0.2
  * scikit-learn==1.0.2
  * pandas 
  * numpy 
  * the [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) software
## Install
```
git clone git@github.com:liulifenyf/TSPTFBS-2.0.git

```

## Tutorial
###  Predicting (389 models were employed to predict the values of inpuy sequences)
```
cd TSPTFBS-2.0
python predict.py <input fasta file>
```
After running the program, a file named 'results.csv' will be generated in the current folder which records the prediction results of the models.
We here provide a test.fa file for an example: 
```
python predict.py Example/test.fa
```
#### Input File Format
The input file must contain DNA sequences which have a length of 500bp with a FASTA format.
A FASTA file of the example is:
```

```
#### Output File Format
The output file will seem like below: the first column represents the names of 389 TFs, the remaining columns (The example has one remaining column because the input file has one enquired DNA sequences) record the probabilities of given DNA sequences to be predicted as a TFBS of one of 389 TFs.
```

```
### DeepLIFT
```
cd TSPTFBS-2.0
python deeplift_test.py <input fasta file> <species> <tf>
```
It should be noted `<`species`>` that one is chosen from 'Zea_mays_models','Arabidopsis_models' and 'Oryza_sativa_models'.
It should be noted <tf> that one is chosen from the tf names of selected species.
After running the program, a dir about deeplift results will be generated in the current folder.
We here provide a test.fa file and employed one of models of Zea mays for an example: 
```
python deeplift_test.py Example/test.fa Zea_mays_models ALF2 
```
### TF-MoDISco
```
cd TSPTFBS-2.0
python modisco_test.py <input fasta file> <species> <tf>
```
It should be noted <species> that one is chosen from 'Zea_mays_models','Arabidopsis_models' and 'Oryza_sativa_models'.
It should be noted <tf> that one is chosen from the tf names of selected species.
After running the program, a dir about tf-modisco results will be generated in the current folder.
We here provide a test.fa file and employed one of models of Zea mays for an example: 
```
python modisco_test.py Example/test.fa Zea_mays_models ALF2 
```
